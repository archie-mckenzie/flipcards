# Flipcards for NYC Civic Engagement Commission

A simple demo game where users can shuffle and flick through the deck of cards designed by the Civic Engagement Commission. Composed completely of frontend HTML, CSS, JS.

TO DO
- Integrate JavaScript (currently the website is static) 
- Format the website (specifically text and images) for mobile
- Add JS map structure for future cards
- Shuffle function using Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm 
- Swipe left and right to switch between cards on mobile (Chrome and Firefox on Desktop have a device version that lets you simulate mobile)
- Click left and right buttons to switch between cards on desktop

BEST PRACTICES
- Individual JS scripts for unrelated processes
- Comments in JS above each function, data structure, and other locations at programmer's discretion
- All images stored exclusively in the 'images' folder
